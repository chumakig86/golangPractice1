# Logo Price Calculation

## Description

The "Logo Size" is a design agency that primarily focuses on creating text-based logos. 
The agency charges 23 cents for each character (regardless of type). 
You need to write a program that calculates the price of a logo based on the number of characters in the client's input string.

## Requirements

- The program should take a string input from the user (the logo text).
- The program should calculate the price based on the number of characters in the string.
  - The cost per character is 23 cents.
- The program should output the price in the following formats:
  1. If the price is less than 1 dollar, print the cost in cents (e.g., `23 cents`).
  2. If the price is greater than or equal to 1 dollar, print the cost in the format: `X $ Y cents` (e.g., `2 $ 53 cents`).

## Example

### Input:
```
Hello:)
```

### Output:
```
1 $ 61 cents
```

## Instructions

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Compile and run the `LogoPriceCalc.go` file.
3. Enter the string without spaces for the logo when prompted.
4. The program will calculate the cost and print it in the required format.
